# Intellij editing tips and tricks

## Shifter
Detects type of selection, line or keyword at caret and shifts it “up” or “down” on keyboard
shortcut. If there’s only one shiftable word in a line, it can be shifted without the caret
touching it. Lowercase/uppercase or lower case with upper first character of shifted words is
maintained.

Default keyboard shortcuts:

    Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Comma : Shift Down
    Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Period : Shift Up
    Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K : Shift Up More*
    Ctrl+Shift+Alt+J : Shift Down More*

# BrowseWordAtCaret
Allows to easily browse next/previous word at caret and highlight other appearances of selected word.
Usage Browse with CTRL-ALT-UP, CTRL-ALT-DOWN :
(note: on default-keymap this shortcut is also for next/previous occurrence).

# JRebel for IntelliJ
JRebel is a productivity tool that allows developers to reload code changes instantly. It skips
the rebuild, restart, and redeploy cycle common in Java development. JRebel enables developers to
get more done in the same amount of time and stay in the flow while coding. JRebel supports a
majority of real-world enterprise java stacks and is easy to install into existing development
environments. The JRebel plugin for IntelliJ IDEA includes the JRebel agent and helps you to
automatically generate the JRebel configuration. It enables JRebel for applications and servers
with a single click and improves the debugging support in the IDE.
