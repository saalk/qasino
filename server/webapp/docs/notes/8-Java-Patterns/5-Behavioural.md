## Behavioral Design Patterns

Pattern Name | Description
- | - 
Template| Method	used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.
Mediator | used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
Chain of Responsibility | used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
Observer | useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.
Strategy | Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
Command | Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.
State | State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.
Visitor | Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
Interpreter | defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
Iterator | used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.
Memento | The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.
